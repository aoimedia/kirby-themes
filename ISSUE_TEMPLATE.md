Welcome!

Want to add a Kirby theme? Excellent!

1. Make sure the theme is compatible with Kirby 3.
2. Make sure it's not already in the repository by searching for the url.

#### Format (Optional)

Here is the preferred formatting suggestion. Just replace the brackets with content.

**Details** [theme website or theme repository on GitHub]
**Live demo** [theme demo URL]

[quote or short information]

Thank you. :)
